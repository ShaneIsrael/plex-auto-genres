These are sample posters I put together using a template from reddit user alexnyc1998

If you would like to use these sample posters simply move them to the posters/standard-movie directory and run the
script with the --set-posters flag.

If you would like to create your own posters matching the sample posters style you can use the provided .psd file to create your own (requires Photoshop).

Names must match your collection names in plex without the PLEX_COLLECTION_PREFIX. Any spaces in the names must be replaced with dashes (-).

Example: 
if you have `PLEX_COLLECTION_PREFIX="*"`
Your "Action" collection in plex would be named "*Action"
So you would title your poster art "action.png" without the "*".

If your collection in plex would be named "Science Fiction" (has a space)
you would title your poster art "science-fiction.png"

The image title must match the collection title, except any spaces are replaced with dashes.
